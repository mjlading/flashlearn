This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
# Environment variables
To run project locally, add the following environment variables to .env.local:
- NEXTAUTH_SECRET
- GITHUB_CLIENT_ID
- GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET

OPENAI_API_KEY

AUTH_GOOGLE_ID
AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET
GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN

ENABLE_CYPRESS_LOGIN=false #turn this on to run cypress tests
CYPRESS_TEST_AC_ID="clvo5f7hy00039ehvjepjy5y8"
# Run in development mode
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## TESTING

# Vitest

Before deployment to vercel, tests are run through github actions. 

for local testing, use 'npm run test', this runs tests that use the testdatabase. 
Vitest is used for integration tests that check if trpc endpoints work the way we expect.

# Cypress

Most of our pages require some form of authentication, this is handled through using google OAuth playground.

https://docs.cypress.io/guides/end-to-end-testing/google-authentication

during testing we use the dev. database with an account that we own to run authentication tests

Add 'CYPRESS_TEST_AC_ID' with the id of the user you wish to test, and set 'ENABLE_CYPRESS_LOGIN' to 'true' within your local environment variables ('.env.local')
Add your user credentials to the variables 'GOOGLE_TEST_ACCOUNT_PWD' and 'GOOGLE_TEST_ACCOUNT_EMAIL' to the cypress environment variables ('Cypress.env.json)
